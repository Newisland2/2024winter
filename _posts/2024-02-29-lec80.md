## Today

* tidymodels.

## Announcement

* Feedback on HW3:

    * Q3.2: Lack of explanation (only description of the patterns) for admissions data.  
    
    * Q4: Lack of explanation for the unusual peak of age 91.
    
    * Q5-6: Wrong `left_join()`. Many memory issues were due to data inflation caused by specifying only `subject_id` in `by` (or `collect()` before filtering).
    
    * Style: 80-character rule.

* HW4 is posted and due Mar 8 @ 11:59pm. Start early and ask questions on Slack or office hours.

* 3 Quizzes (databases, ggplot2, stringr) due Mar 8 @ 11:59pm.
