## Checklist on your resume

> A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.  

- [ ] Linux scripting  
- [ ] Git/GitHub (give your GitHub handle)  
- [ ] Container technology: Docker  
- [ ] Data wrangling (Tidyverse)   
- [ ] Data visualization (ggplot2)  
- [ ] Frontend development (shiny, web app)  
- [ ] Databases: OLAP (DuckDB), Google BigQuery (spend more time self-studying SQL)  
- [ ] Cloud computing (GCP, AWS, Azure, OCI) (if you use it)    
- [ ] High-performance computing (HPC) on cluster (if you use Hoffman2)  
- [ ] Deep learning with Keras+TensorFlow (PyTorch is more popular in research) (if you use it in HW5)  

* Make your GitHub repo `biostat-203b-2024-winter` public (after Apr 15, 2024) and show off your work to back your resume. Feel free to modify the reports after this course. You can make your GitHub repository into a webpage by using GitHub Pages.  

* **Use** these tools in your daily work: use Git/GitHub for all your homework and research projects, write weekly research report using Quarto/RMarkdown/Jupyter Notebook, give presentation using ggplot2 and Shiny, write blog/tutorial, ...

## Course evaluation

Please do it **NOW**.

## Today

* Neural network (cont'd, CNN, RNN/LSTM, GAN).

## Announcement

* HW5 is due Mar 22 @ 11:59pm. Start early and ask questions on Slack or office hours. No late submission.

* [UCLA Generative AI for Healthcare Workshop](https://datax.ucla.edu/news-events/events/generative-ai-healthcare-workshop): Apr 19, 2024.

## Q&A

* HW5 taking too long! Do less exhaustive grid search, or try smarter search strategies. Separate each task into a separate document.

    * Tidymodels: `tune_grid()`, [`tune_bayes()`](https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_bayes.html) (Bayesian optimization through GP), [`tune_sim_anneal()`](https://finetune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_sim_anneal.html) (simulated annealing), [`tune_race_anova()`](https://finetune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_race_anova.html) (racing with ANOVA),  [`tune_race_win_loss()`](https://finetune.tidymodels.org/reference/tune_race_win_loss.html) (racing with win/loss statistics).

    * Python Scikit-Learn: [`GridSearchCV()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV), [`RandomizedSearchCV()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV), ... See [reference](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#hyper-parameter-optimizers).

* HW5: For grading purpose, do not delete rows.
