## Q&A

* PhysioNet credential: supply my name (Hua Zhou) and my ucla email as mentor.

* Why the need for passphrase for SSH key? What's the difference between using the SSH key passphrase versus using server password for each SSH connection?

* A bug of RStudio Desktop on MacOS (thanks to Sebastian): the Homebrew installed programs not in the `PATH` of the shell launched by rendering. 

* Trouble building `pdf_book` of the R4 book? `gitbook` suffices for HW1.
