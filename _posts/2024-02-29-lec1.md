## Today

* Tidymodels (cont'd).

## Announcement

* Feedback on HW3 (thanks to Tomoki)

    * Q3.2: Lack of explanation (only description of the patterns) for admissions data.  
    
    * Q4: Lack of explanation for the unusual peak of age 91.
    
    * Q5-6: Wrong `left_join()`. Many memory issues were due to data inflation caused by specifying only `subject_id` in `by` (or `collect()` before filtering).
    
    * 80-character rule.

* HW4 is posted and due Mar 8 @ 11:59pm. Start early and ask questions on Slack or office hours.

## Q&A

* [Statistical learning vs machine learning](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2024winter/slides/14-statlearn/statlearn.html#statistical-learning-vs-machine-learning).
