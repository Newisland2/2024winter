Welcome to Biostat 203B: *Introduction to Data Science*. 

## Today

* Introduction and course logistics  

* Linux basics

## Assignment (not graded)

* Fill out a short [survey](https://uclahs.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cvuPk044ONufmKi). It helps me better tailor the course to your background.

* Slack channel: inform us your <http://ucla.slack.com/> username in this [form](https://forms.gle/eC6RNTGoQTFNt1Jd8). TA team and I will answer your questions on Slack at our earliest convenience. It is a more effective way to get help than email and office hours.   

* Read the [Lab 1](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2024winter/labs/lab01/lab01.html) for creating the software environment for this class. We'll go through it in lab.
