## Q&A

* Want to enjoy the speed of data.table while using dplyr? Check out [dtplyr](https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/).

* Q: R crashes and then I can never open it again. A: Locate the `.RData` file and delete it. Carefully inspect your code which may generate extremely large R objects causing the crash. Configure R to not save workspace as `.RData` on exit and not restore workspace on startup. [R4DS recommendation](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts#what-is-the-source-of-truth): do not save R workspace as `.RData` on exit nor restore workspace on startup.
