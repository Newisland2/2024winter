This tutorial assumes that you have already installed R, RStudio, and Git on your computer. If not, please refer to the [Lab 1](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2024winter/labs/lab01/lab01.html).

# Set up GitHub repo for 203B homework

- On <https://github.com/>, create a **private** repository `biostat-203b-2024-winter` and add `Hua-Zhou` and TA team (`tomokiokuno0528` for Lec 1; `jonathanhori` and `jasenzhang1` for Lec 80) as your collaborators with write permission. This repository is for submitting your 203B homework.

- You can use RStudio to git clone the `biostat-203b-2024-winter` repository to your local machine: `File` -> `New Project...` -> `Version Control` -> `Git` -> input `Repository URL:`, `Project directory name:` (203b-hw).

- Alternatively, in Terminal (Mac Terminal, Windows Git Bash, or Windows WSL), you can run
```{bash}
#| eval: false
git clone [SSH_ADDRESS] ~/203b-hw
```
to clone your homework repository to a folder called `203b-hw` under your home directory on your computer. `[SSH_ADDRESS]` is obtained by clicking the menu `<> Code` -> `SSH` on the repository page on GitHub. Then you can double click the `biostat-203b-2024-winter.Rproj` file to open the RStudio project.

# MIMIC Data

Much of homework and exercises are demonstrated on the [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/) v2.2 data set. Download the data to your computer from [here](https://ucla.box.com/s/u90zkq9cvpv8p5s064s8bvy40c0tqx33) (7.69 GB), and make it available at `~/mimic`. For example, you can create a symbolic link by
```{bash}
#| eval: false
ln -s /PATH/TO/YOUR/MIMIC_FOLDER ~/mimic
```
Your homework solution should always read data from `~/mimic`. This is critical for TA team to reproduce your homework.
```{bash}
ls -l ~/mimic/
```

# Start with homework 1

- Create and switch to branch `develop`.

- Create folder `hw1`.

- Download [`hw1.qmd`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCLA-Biostat-203B/2024winter/main/hw/hw1/hw1.qmd) to `hw1/` folder. Make a copy and rename it to `hw1sol.qmd`, which will be your homework solution file.

- Demonstrate Q2: include CITI completion report and completion certificate.

- Demonstrate Q3.2.

- Demonstrate Q5.
